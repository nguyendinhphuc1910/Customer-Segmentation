The data I used is e-commerce retail data in Brazil, consisting of 4 datasets.

The project includes the following main parts:
- Segment customers based on their characteristics and shopping behavior through the use of the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model.
- Create specific customer segments such as best customers, loyal customers, potential customers, new customers, promising customers, and customers at risk of leaving. This helps businesses apply appropriate marketing and customer care strategies for each segment, to increase the effectiveness of customer outreach and retention.
- Analyze transaction locations and times by building heat maps to identify areas with the highest transaction volume, the largest number of stores, and customers. This information helps businesses make decisions about expanding or optimizing points of sale, analyzing delivery times to determine whether delivery times are on time, late, or early, to improve operations and customer service.
- Determine effective promotion timing by analyzing transaction time data to determine the most appropriate time to implement promotional programs, helping to optimize revenue and improve marketing campaign effectiveness.
- Analyze products and evaluate products after identifying popular products to know which products have been recognized and favored by customers, from which businesses can focus resources on promoting other products.
- Conduct sentiment analysis in product evaluation to understand customers' feelings and feedback on products, helping to improve product and service quality.
